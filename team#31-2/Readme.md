#Women Empowerment

Trying to make a women safety application that will fetch the user's location(in terms of latitude and longitude) and then send the location to nearby locals who are willing to help. These locals also would have registered into the application. 

Currently working on the database part of this application. Fetching local's location from the app and storing it to the database.Building a function that will be called to check the distance of the local from the woman's location for ease of approach. Classifying locals on the basis of pincodes so that searching becomes easier.


Adding a form to register into the application. Working on two paths i.e. registering as a user or as a local helper.


Pincode fetched from the address of the location and search executed in the model, in order to find helping hands quickly in the area whose pincode is returned.


Finished with the UI part of the application and rest of the code.

Uploaded the API of the application for reference and a complete code folder(files apart from the library files that we wrote, i.e. generated code).

The build and .dart_tool folders are hidden so you can refer it from the google drive link to the project.
