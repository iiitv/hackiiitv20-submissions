Nowadays the vast majority of the students have the fundamental accessibility of a smartphone with a basic yet restricted data plan; however, they don't have proper resources to channelize their studies. In this hack, we have made a library of best free-access courses and assets on the web, which will help the students in saving their time and internet while certainly providing the way through the huge information barrier.

Due to time-barrier we couldn't been able to put more amount of playlists of the courses and design a very interactive UI but we have done what we could. But if given more time we can update various functionality and UI for a better user interactive view.
