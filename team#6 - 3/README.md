# Hack Title - Find-My-Doctor
As we all know that in this Covid-19 pandemic it is dangerous for anyone to go out. It has become really difficult for people with problems and diseases other than Covid-19 to go out for medical check-up or any other kind of medical help. For instance a person who has had a recent surgery needs to consult to his doctor frequently about his rehabilitation process. So time-to-time he/she has to visit the doctor even for a simple talk.Our idea is to provide medication to patients sitting at home by the specialist doctors of their choice. The title of our hack is Find-Your-Doctor. We have created an interface where patients are given their own accounts where they can login and find their medical history and other details which are stored there. A list of doctors with their qualifications and speciality will be provided to the patients. They will have choice to choose the doctor with whom they want to discuss their problem. They can type about their problem to the specialist doctor of their choice. When the doctor logins to his/her account then he/she can analyze the problems faced by the patient and provide proper medication and suggestions. The patients will be provided with all kinds of contact details of the doctor and the timings of their duty according to which, if required, patients can also schedule audio/video call appointment with the doctor which may also provide a personal touch to the conversation.
