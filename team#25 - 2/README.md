# Emergengy Alert

Our project is all about helping women whenever they feel rape threat or any emergency condition .
Once the person registers on our app or website we would be sending a "ring" consisting of button that has a in built gps tracker in it .
And when person presses that button continuously for 3 times it would mail us a location coordinates of that person .
Accordingly we will be sending the loaction and details of person to closest police station in our database and also to the emergency number that person gave us while registering .
(But because of  lack of sources and team members staying away we are not able to make the ring so we gave that emergency button on the page page that just opens after loging  ).
This will do the same work .

## Working

We have used linked list to store the information of user while registering and for checking username and password while login.
