Our idea is based on theme 6 which is Intelligent Transportation System for smart cities

Currently the whole world is going through a Pandemic. With no vaccines available till now, Social Distancing is the only way to save ourselves from this pandemic. 
With lockdowns being lifted across the globes, it has become necessary for people to go to work by putting their lives on risk. Not many are blessed with personal vehicles and have to use public transport for travel. 

We as a team have decided to solve their Travel issue in such a Pandemic through an Android app. 
Our app name is SafeTravel.

We will build an app which will help people to check the Public Transport (Buses) timings and track them in real time for total number of seats which are used by people and also live location of the Bus.

So Basically people will not have to come early to stops and wait for buses, if some buses are full, then they have the option to know about it earlier and hence can take the next bus.

In future, we would also like to integrate payment gateway in our app to make it complete Contactless Experience for travellers in the global pandemic.
