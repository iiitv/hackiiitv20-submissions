# Care Connect
An *online platform* for mental support communities to the patients of any kind of disease. :wave:<br>
This project is for advancing the medical industry by information technology by providing community support to any patient. For a long term disease patient, it is necessary for them to be stable in medicines as well as in mental health. So, in this platform, they can find a community of patients, their relatives, or their friends who are experiencing the same illness from the same disease. Nowadays, depression is also a major problem. It can also solve that problem by providing community support to those patients.
<br>
<b>Now let's come to the technical part.</b>

<h2>Future Scope</h2>
- We are trying to secure Posts in community by implementing it through Blockchain technology. <br>
- Recommender system to recommend new users to add them as friends based on features like illness, location (decreasing priority) by using Data mining concepts.<br>
- We can provide suggetions about communities by using Data mining techniques.<br>
- For validation of the patients, the registered user will be required to upload a certificate or medical prescription from registered hospital certifying his illness<br>
- Notify / call friends in times of emergency<br>
- In the profile, his history can be recorded using the hospital data<br>
- Can virtually talk with each other by Video conferencing.<br>
