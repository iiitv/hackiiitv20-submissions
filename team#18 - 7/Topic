SMART POWER-GRID MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Our project revolves around smart power distribution and regulation of the price of electricity accordingly, to minimize the wastage of energy.
We aimed at predicting the future daily usage of power/energy in a city using the known historical data of a location.
For the purpose of this we used concepts of machine learning: Sequential Regression, LSTM Layer.

As we all know that energy companies only produce and supply fixed amount of electricity, and if there is a sudden surge in demand then they would have to buy electricty at much higher rates and then supply it to the consumers. 
According to our hack, the idea is that once we determine the predicted energy consumption which becomes a threshold, we set a base price per unit of energy consumed
(say Rs. x/unit for a regular month of November). For December, which is a cold month and has a huge energy consumption during “CHRISTMAS” and “New Year’s holiday”
the base rate becomes Rs. x.10/unit) 
As long as a consumer's usage does not cross this threshold value he/she pays as per the base price but if this usage exceeds the threshold the consumer would be charged a price higher than the base price for all the extra units used.
(Now as the historical data shows that a consumers will use Y units energy in November and predicting on past 15 years of trend there will be consumption of Y+30 units in December.
 We are already charging Rs x.10/unit on regular usage, but if the consumer passes their threshold they will be charge Rs. x.40/unit  for Y to Y+10 and  Rs. x.60/unit for Y+10 to Y+30)
The customers would be notified of their power usage in case they cross the threshold limit.

This method would keep a consumer aware and conscious of his/her power requirements which would lead to its judicial usage and will be profitable for the energy companies, especially in India where most energy companies suffer huge losses.
