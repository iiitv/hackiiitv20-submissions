Smart power-grid management system
Our project revolves around smart power distribution to keep the daily power consumption of a user in check.
We aimed at predicting the future usage of power/energy using the known historical data of a location. For the purpose of this we used concepts of machine learning: Sequential Regression, LSTM Layer.
The idea is that once we determine the predicted energy consumption which becomes a threshold, we set a base price per unit of energy consumed.
As long as a consumer's usage does not cross this threshold value he/she pays as per the base price but if this usage exceeds the threshold the consumer would be charged a price higher than the base price for all the extra units used.
The customers would be notified of their power usage in case they cross the threshold limit.
This method would keep a consumer aware and conscious of his/her power requirements which would lead to its judicial usage.
